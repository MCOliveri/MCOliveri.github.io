    <h1>Possible images for my website</h1>
    <h2>Computer Science Python Projects</h2>
    <p>This image would be paired with the work sample of my python projects. The connection is that the image used represents programming, which is fitting as it aligns with my informatics major and what field I am aiming to enter professionally.</p>

    <h2>Computer Science C Projects</h2>
    <p>This image would be paired with the work sample of my C projects. The connection is that the image used represents programming in C, which is fitting as it aligns with my informatics major and what field I am aiming to enter professionally. Showing that I know more than only Python.</p>

    <h2>Travelling Photo</h2>
    <p>This image would be paired with the About Me section of my website. I think adding more photos would allow people to get a better grasp on who I am than solely an image of what I look like.</p>
