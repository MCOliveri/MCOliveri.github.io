        <h1>Climate Change on a Smaller Scale</h1>
        <p>Though it is largely up to policymakers and systemic changes to impact widespread carbon emissions, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be doing our part.</p>
        <h2>How do individuals contribute to climate change?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In a study conducted by <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-top-1-of-emitters-produce-over-1000-times-more-co2-than-the-bottom-1" target="_blank">iea.org</a>, the global average amount of CO2 created per capita is roughly 4.7 tonnes.</li>
            <li>The North American upper bound in this study produces 56.5 tonnes of CO2 annually.</li>
            <li>North America dwarfs the upper bound of the rest of the world which has individuals emitting 33.9 tonnes annually</li>
            <li>The product of our combined overindulgence in fossil fuels is warming the planet due to the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/" target="_blank">greenhouse effect</a> in which our greenhouse emissions form a veil, trapping energy from escaping our atmosphere and raising temperatures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What can individuals do to lessen their effects on climate change? According to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions" target="_blank">un.org</a>, we can:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prevent excessive energy use by unplugging unused electronics, using cold water when washing clothes, and hanging things to dry when possible. These are effective because a lot of our energy comes from coal, oil, and gas, and using less energy can reduce the usage of these fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Taking public transport whenever possible will reduce emissions if you were to otherwise drive a car, due to a small amount of individuals owning electric cars, using less gas-powered machinery will reduce emissions.</li>
            <li>Cleaning up litter and recycling are also good ways to reduce harm to the environment by directly aiding in the prevention of water contamination and waste production.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, speak out and make your voice heard. There is only so much individuals can do to prevent climate change, the real and most meaningful change will come from the top.</li>
        </ol>
