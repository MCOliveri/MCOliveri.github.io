    <h1>About Me-Michael Oliveri</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am currently a Junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Informatics with a concentration
        in data science. Formerly a computer science major I am eager to experience ways in which I can attribute my
        learnings to the outside world. The ever-changing landscape of Information Sciences is an environment that I
        cannot wait to plunge into after my graduation.</p>

    <h2>Influences & Experiences</h2>

    <p>Growing up with the rapid development of technology, a father who works in the field, and a passion for all
        things computers has naturally led me down the path of studying Informatics. Having a rather technologically
        inept family (sorry guys) always led to me being the one having to troubleshoot their issues. And honestly, I am
        grateful, because without those experiences I wouldn't have been able to gain the problem-solving skills that I
        am so proud of today.</p>

    <p>Though I am very grateful for my family, and the support they have given me for all of these years. I am
        particularly thankful for my older brother. When I was in high school, and admittedly a bit aimless, he was the
        one who encouraged me to pursue a degree in Informatics. Due to him giving me the confidence to pursue this
        degree, I am able to thrive in a field I love. For that, I will be forever thankful.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>

    <p>When I'm not sitting behind a computer and coding until my fingers fall off, I enjoy reading, traveling, and
        spending time with my friends. I find that with all the time I spend looking at a screen, activities that allow
        me to break away from my computer for a while are invaluable.</p>

    <p>Though I am trying to break into new hobbies like art and video editing (despite admittedly arriving at the scene
        a bit late), I will always find comfort in a nice vacation, a captivating book, and quality time with my family
        and friends.</p>
